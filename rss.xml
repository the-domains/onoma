            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Y-3 Launches Y-3 Sport</h1><p>Though Y-3 is a beautiful collaboration between avant-garde Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto and global sportswear brand adidas, surprisingly, it's always been a fashion-first line. After 15 years, Yamamoto has thought it the proper time to go deep into Y-3's DNA and design its first-ever fully functional sport line.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/37ad461f62031730d604252b2e606f50cc4dbdcd.jpg"></article>]]></description>
